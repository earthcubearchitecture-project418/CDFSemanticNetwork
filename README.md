# CDF Semantic Network

This repository is an experiment.   It holds the output of GeoCodes Gleaner runs done on the various repositories that make up the EarthCube Council of Data Facilities.  (CDF)

Here we will describe the runs being conducted with the GeoCodes Gleaner package and more importantly the output and errors from those runs.   The results of these runs generate a  data graph or semantic network of resources exposed by CDF members.  

Initially this is focus on type data resources.  However we can also scope type organization and from the work of the EarthCube Resource Registry Work other resource types will populate this semantic network as well.   

There are several goals for this repo;

* Help facilities both declare their offerings and also help them assess their publishing patterns and inspect the patterns of others. 
* Provide a means to more routinely perform these indexes, address incremental updates and also help describe and address errors in the publishing process and harvesting code and work flow.  
* Provide a start for addressing the use of shape files to address validation and shared publishing patterns.
