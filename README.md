CDF Semantic Network

This repoisitory is an experiment.   It's being set up
to provide a place to describe the runs being conducted 
with the GeoCodes Gleaner package the resulting data
graphs (semantic networks).

There are several goals 

* How best for facilities to have their offerings 
exposed (YAML, JSON-LD (VoID, ?))
* How best to report errors back to providers
* How best to describe the shapes being used for validation
