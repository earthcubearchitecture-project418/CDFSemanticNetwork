# Data Index

## Index

This is the run index.  It provides a quick bit of info about a run and then points to the more detailed run description. 

1. [CDFSemNetD1](runs/CDFSemNetD1.md)  (Jun 24th, 2019)
   CDF Semantic Network Dev run 1:  This is actually run6 of a set of runs to test some elements of Gleaner such as graph validation.
2. Fuzzy Four   (Jun 23rd, 2019)
   This was a developmental run to test out detecting errors in data graphs.  Some of these "errors"  are due to the code making assumptions in cases of multi-typed resources and others are errors in things like IRI construction or other RDF formating issues.   
3. UnavHydro   (Jun 19th, 2019)
   This was a basic run to update the UNAVCO and HydroShare graphs.  There is nothing special about this run and it was done with a rather old version of the gleaner code.
