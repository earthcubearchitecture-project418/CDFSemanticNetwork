# How to Join the CDF Semantic Network

## Intro

This is a place holder document for how to request additions or edits 
to the master cdf.yml file. 

At this time we ask you submit an issue to this repo requesting an 
edit to the cdf.yml file for any additions or edits you would like to 
suggest to the master configuration file.

## What we need

The main item we need is simply the URL for the sitemaps file your site
is publishing.  This can be in either XML or TEXT format but we highly 
recommend the XML format.  You can find more information about this at 
http://sitemaps.org .

Typically this should be a file named sitemap.xml located in the root
of your domain.
